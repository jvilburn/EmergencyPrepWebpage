# Ward Directory Map - Electron Application

The Ward Directory Map has been successfully converted to an Electron desktop application, providing native file system access and enhanced functionality.

## What's New in Electron Version

### ✅ **Completed Features**
- **Native File Dialogs**: Open and save CSV files using OS-native dialogs
- **Enhanced File Management**: Direct file system access without browser restrictions
- **Existing Functionality Preserved**: All web-based features work identically
- **Offline Tile Support**: Existing tile manifest system continues to work
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Windows, macOS, and Linux compatible

### 📋 **How to Run**

1. **Install Dependencies** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Development Mode** (with live reload):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### 🎯 **Key Improvements**

#### Native File Operations
- **CSV Loading**: Uses OS file picker instead of web file input
- **CSV Saving**: Uses OS save dialog with proper file extension handling
- **Better UX**: No more downloads folder clutter

#### Enhanced Architecture
- **Secure IPC**: Uses contextBridge for secure renderer-main communication
- **Modern Electron**: Built with Electron 28.x and latest security practices
- **Backward Compatible**: Still works as web app in browsers

### 🚀 **Next Steps** (Planned Features)

#### Native Tile Downloading
- **Background Downloads**: Download missing tiles directly from the app
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with cancellation
- **Automatic Manifest Updates**: Tile manifests update automatically after downloads
- **Rate Limiting**: Respectful downloading with proper delays

#### Additional Enhancements
- **Auto-Updates**: Built-in application update system
- **Better Error Handling**: Native system notifications
- **Performance Monitoring**: Built-in tile usage statistics

#### Security Features
- **Context Isolation**: Renderer process cannot access Node.js directly
- **Secure APIs**: Limited API surface through preload script
- **CSP Ready**: Content Security Policy compatible

### 🧪 **Testing**

The integration has been validated with:
- ✅ All required files present
- ✅ Package.json configuration correct
- ✅ Main process IPC handlers implemented
- ✅ Preload script security bridge working
- ✅ FileManager Electron integration complete
- ✅ Tile directory structure intact

### 📊 **Migration Benefits**

1. **No Browser Limitations**: Full file system access
2. **Better Performance**: Native application performance
3. **Offline First**: No internet required after tile download
4. **Professional UX**: Native OS integration
5. **Future Ready**: Foundation for advanced features

### 🔍 **Validation**

Run the integration test:
```bash
node test-electron.js
```

This validates all Electron components are properly configured.
